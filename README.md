[Coding Isn't Just for Coders Anymore](https://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2016-06-08/coding-isnt-just-for-coders-anymore)

## What I found interesting

This article addresses the increasing need for people with coding skills,
even those whose jobs initially did not seem to need coding. I found
this article interesting for a variety of reasons. First, this has not been
the first article I have seen that outlines the high demand for coding 
skills, and it's amazing to see that after all these years, coding skillsets
seem to never go out of demand. Second, this topic reminds me of another
topic, particularly self learning. Self learning, especially
within the software engineering field, is so important and it is so great
to hear that other people, who do not even go to college to code, can 
pick up coding by just using the internet's resources. There are so many
occasions where people graduate college with a non CS degree, have to do
some sort of coding on the job, and find themselves loving it, teaching 
themselves, and completely shifting their career towards software 
engineering.



### Response from Jay Li 
Hello Matt! I think this is an interesting take on how the evergrowing demand for coding skills will be needed in multiple industries today. I would not be surprised if computer science is implemented in elementary education in the next few years. While I do think having this technical skill is at the forefront of how we live our lives, I still think with knowledge to code comes with ethical responsibilities. Nonetheless, I am excited that Computer Science education has become more accessible to people who have a personal computer and anyone is able to teach themselves basic coding skills.
